The Haskell Notebook (another Haskell Cookbook) contains some common and not so common Haskell programming idioms that are packaged in a collection of working/compilable examples. There is also a collection of source code from other functional programming languages including Lisp and Erlang. This project is similar to other cookbook projects that you may find on the web for various other programming languages.
