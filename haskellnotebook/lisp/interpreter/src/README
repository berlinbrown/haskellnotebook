* Description
**************

Peter Norvig created JScheme, a Lisp Scheme dialect written in Java. 
It was created in 1998 and it has since been forked, extended and 
used quite extensively in other modern projects for the web and elsewhere. 
The C lisp intepreter is based on the JScheme interpreter. 
The JScheme code is copyrighted to Peter Norvig
This is  only a modifications to make our Lisp even lighter 
than it was originally. Norvig's most recent implementation of 
JScheme contains 1905 lines of Java code. 
This implementation contains 2000 lines of C code 
wrapped in additional Javadoc comments, including implemenations 
of list, hashtable datastructures.


There is a lot that can be added to Norvig's implementation. 
Add full support for a R5RS Scheme Implementation. 
Add better input/output support. 
Copy interesting functions from Arc or Common Lisp. 
Write a Scheme compiler. In fact, the source code in my implementation 
and Norvig's is fairly straightforward,
