This simple example shows how to read URLs from a file and then
use the http client libraries to perform a HTTP GET request to 
extract the content and print to the console

Use ./http.sh to connect

For a more complicated example (csv file), download the
following.  Botlist URL data drop. It contains over 100,000 URLs 
and associated titles and keywords.  Would be an interesting project
for map / reduce functions.
wget http://openbotlist.googlecode.com/files/botlist_datadump.tar.gz
