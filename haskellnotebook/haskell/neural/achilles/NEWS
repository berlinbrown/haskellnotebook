Nothing particularly special, really.  I have changed the version
numbers to something more sane, being that they were arbitrarily
stuck at 0.0.x for over a year, and I couldn't decide what consituted
a major version shift.  In any case, a scientific application like
this versions differently from other, utility software.  As more
tests and experiments are added, increasing the version number simply
indicates to people that there is a version out there that is
newer, with more features perhaps.  It's not about creating a
"major version branch" with specific functionality and releasing
"minor revisions" to fix bugs.  There's no target functionality
in this program, it simply exists to be fiddled with, to amuse
or to learn.

All this being said, the program has not undergone any major revision
in the past year.  I have been busy, have had other concerns.
I have had a few people voice their interest in helping out,
and a friend of mine has managed to port this to Mac OS X (yay!),
and that will be incorporated into the next version once I sort
things out.  With my declining interest in associating myself with
C or C++, I doubt that this current codebase is going to be much
altered by myself; however, I often toy with plans to rewrite the
whole mess in Common LISP or Scheme--where the incredible flexibility
of LISP will make life a lot easier on me.  But, alas..
